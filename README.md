# poster-parser

Martin Mudenda Bbela

This is an application that will alow you to take a picture of a poster and seamlessly create a strava event. 

Built in android studio it will take quite a sec to build the first time

I built it as a class project first then enhanced it to use a bunch of different libraries mainly:

Google mlkit text recognition,

Natty date parser,

Picasso image maniputation api

Theres a few bugs in it  but it otherwise works seamelessly. sinmply build and deploy on you phone in android studio.
